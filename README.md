# Timer-Interrupt
Automatic street light control using LDR as the sensor and an LED as an example of street light. Performed a small simulation of an arduino board along with LDR and LED to simulate the automatic street light control in TinkerCAD. Checking the LDR value for gating (with a delay of 1 minute generated by timer). Then based on the LDR value, the LED should be turned ON or OFF.
